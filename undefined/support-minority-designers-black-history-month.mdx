In the United States, February is [Black History Month](https://blackhistorymonth.gov/).

Black History Month is more than just a month. It’s a reminder of the hardships Black Americans have faced and continue to face, and it’s a chance to celebrate the Black community, Black culture, and Black excellence.  

Additionally, this opportunity for reflection and celebration _does not_ _and should not_ just span the 28 days of February. It’s a call-to-action for the months and years ahead. Black history is American history.

Listed below are several tremendous associations that support Black and minority individuals in the architecture, interior, landscape, and entertainment design industries.

Organization**:** The Directory of African American Architects

**Description:** “The Directory of African American Architects is maintained as a public service to promote an awareness of who African American architects are and where they’re located. The sole qualification for listing is licensure in one of the fifty US jurisdictions and their territories.”
