Anne Lacaton and Jean-Phillippe Vassal together comprise the namesake of French architecture firm Lacaton & Vassal. The firm has won the [2021 Pritzker Prize award](https://www.pritzkerprize.com/about), regarded as the highest honor in the architecture profession. We extend huge congratulations for achieving this distinction.

From some of their earlier projects — such as the [Maison Latapie](https://www.lacatonvassal.com/index.php?idp=25), the [European Institute of Human Sciences in Saint-Denis](https://www.lacatonvassal.com/index.php?idp=53), and the [Architecture School in Nantes](https://www.lacatonvassal.com/index.php?idp=55) — Lacaton & Vassal has invariably left its mark on the architecture world. Their core values of sustainability, well-being, and social responsibility shine through in each project. With particular attention and respect to the existing environment, Lacaton & Vassal believe that buildings are only beautiful when people feel good there. It’s no surprise they’ve won the distinction with such an approach.

Be sure to look at the [Lacaton & Vassal website](https://www.lacatonvassal.com/) for more information on their projects and their unique design philosophy.
