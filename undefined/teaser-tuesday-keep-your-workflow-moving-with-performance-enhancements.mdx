We’re back with another behind-the-scenes look at upcoming enhancements you can enjoy with #Vectorworks2021\. This week’s spotlight shines on the performance improvements to 3D navigation and more.

Your designs are complex, and you need software to handle it all. We’ve done our research — by analyzing large project files shared by users, we found ways to enhance the overall performance of Vectorworks.

Vectorworks 2021 brings you quality and performance improvements that open files up to five times faster. You’ll find the responsiveness you need for all levels of detail in your projects.

Additional information caching is engineered to unlock the full potential of your hardware by making more operations multi-threaded and eliminating redundant operations to shorten your wait times and enhance your experience in the 3D environment.

**“Some improvements may not seem so glamorous but will be a real boon to productivity and efficiency.”**

**— François Lévy, AIA, NCARB, Principal at François Lévy Architecture + Interiors**
