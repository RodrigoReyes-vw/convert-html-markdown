Monday blues slowing you down? Speed up your workflow with these new Marionette scripts.

As a direct response to your feedback on the Vectorworks Forum, you can now create panel patterns with existing 3D symbols. This builds off a software command that produces a surface array across a NURBS surface. Unlike the [Create Surface Array command](https://www.vectorworks.net/training/2019/getting-started-guides/3d-free-form-modeling/nurbs-modeling-surface-array?utm%5Fcampaign=blog&utm%5Fsource=button&utm%5Fmedium=planetvectorworks&utm%5Fcontent=marionettepanels060319), these scripts canâ€™t be used with curved surfaces, but they can create variation with either panel rotation or panel patterning along a flat surface. 

Additionally, you can set the horizontal and vertical reveals separately to allow for quick visualization of multiple design options, distributed from left to right, top to bottom.

With this kind of algorithmic modeling, replicating patterns becomes seamless. Take advantage of this custom-built tool and see for yourself how much time you can save.
