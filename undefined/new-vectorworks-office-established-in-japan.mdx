We’re thrilled to announce the establishment of a new Vectorworks office in Japan.

The Nemetschek Group’s acquisition of A&A Co., Ltd., the Japanese distributor of Vectorworks software since 1985, sets the stage for Vectorworks to expand its reach within a diverse range of designers in product design, AEC, interiors, landscape, and entertainment industries.

"Advancing our presence in Japan marks a significant milestone in our commitment to serving designers in East Asia and beyond," said Vectorworks CEO Dr. Biplab Sarkar. "The A&A team has a rich history in the region and has been instrumental in delivering Vectorworks' products while providing unparalleled support to our customers. With this committed and experienced team, I am confident in our ongoing success and growth in Japan."

Vectorworks will tap into A&A's extensive sales infrastructure, deep market insights, and unwavering technical support spanning nearly four decades to elevate the overall customer experience. As part of this transition, the A&A business will undergo a rebranding to become Vectorworks Japan, Co., Ltd., effective May 1st, 2024.

“This acquisition is a strong move in driving our business forward in the Asia Pacific region as we continue to lead designers across the globe into the future of digitalization with intelligent software solutions,” said César Flores Rodríguez, Chief Division Officer Planning & Design and Digital Twin of the Nemetschek Group. “This expansion reflects our commitment to sustained development and leadership in the AEC industry and lays the foundation for an advantageous growth strategy.”

In addition, by leveraging the expertise of A&A’s product team, this partnership will guarantee the delivery of top-notch software updates across all Vectorworks products. A&A President Takashi Yokota will be supported by Director of Operations Takeshi Kimura and Director of Sales Moriaki Honma in managing operations at the Japan office location.

“After many years of close collaboration with our partners in the United States, it is an honor to officially join the Vectorworks team in this new capacity,” said A&A President Takashi Yokota.

The establishment of the new Vectorworks office in Japan through the acquisition of A&A Co., Ltd. marks a significant step in the company's expansion and commitment to serving designers in East Asia.
