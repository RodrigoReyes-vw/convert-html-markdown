Quality assurance and BIM go hand-in-hand 🤝, just ask our CEO, Dr. Biplab Sarkar:

> _“Quality assurance is a critical component of BIM, but many architecture firms have historically lacked a robust way to accurately and efficiently check their models. We’re proud to alleviate this pain point for our users in collaboration with Solibri through this integrated, flexible and time-saving solution. Solibri Inside provides automatic rule-based checking in a convenient application, so architects can confidently deliver high-quality, precise designs every time.”_

That's right! We're proud to announce that [Solibri Inside](https://www.solibri.com/inside?utm%5Fcampaign=Solibri%2520Inside&utm%5Fsource=vectorworks) is now available in [Vectorworks 2023 SP3](../../../net/vectorworks/blog/vectorworks-2023-service-pack-3-released.html)! We've partnered with our [Nemetschek sister company](https://www.nemetschek.com/en) to offer you a new way to deliver quality designs comfortably. With Solibri Inside, you can validate, report, and modify design errors in an easy-to-use model checker directly inside Vectorworks design and BIM software.
