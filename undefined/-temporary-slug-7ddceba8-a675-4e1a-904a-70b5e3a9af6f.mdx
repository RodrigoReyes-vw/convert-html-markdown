The primary issue plaguing modern Japanese wooden architecture lies in the abandonment of traditional carpentry methods in favor of hardware and pre-cutting machinery, neglecting the invaluable knowledge passed down through generations. Regrettably, the art of Japanese carpentry, encompassing wood framing, joinery, and finishing without reliance on hardware, is at risk of fading away without proper training and preservation.

In response, this project seeks to bridge the gap between ancient wisdom and contemporary design, reimagining the essence of Japanese architecture for the modern era.
