For the first time in its 108-year history, the Royal Horticultural Society’s Chelsea Flower Show will be held in autumn instead of spring.

Known as the world’s greatest flower show, the event is taking place from September 20 to September 25, 2021, to highlight the seasonality of flora; the autumnal show will offer a different look and feel than the typical late-spring show, which occurred virtually this year.

Excitingly, many Vectorworks users are gearing up for Chelsea! Here are just a few of the projects that will be showcased this year.

## The Florence Nightingale Garden by Robert Myers

The first designer is Robert Myers, whose spring garden is called “The Florence Nightingale Garden: A Celebration of Modern-day Nursing.” It’s particularly poignant considering the toll the pandemic continues to take on healthcare professionals.

“Many of the plants he \[Myers\] uses have a medical benefit that would have been known by Florence,” reads the RHS website.[ Learn more about the garden](https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/virtual-chelsea/looking-forward-to-chelsea/the-florence-nightingale-garden).

## The Yeo Valley Organic Garden by Tom Massey

Next is Tom Massey. The garden, “The Yeo Valley Organic Garden,” is based on the Yeo Valley organic garden in Somerset, UK. The garden contains a soothing stream connecting its spaces as well as a woodland full of fruiting, flowering, and native trees that represent a grazing area in nature.[ Learn more about the garden](https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/virtual-chelsea/gardens/2021/the-yeo-valley-organic-garden).

## The M&G Garden by Harris Bugg Studio

The garden visualizes one of today’s environmental dilemmas: the intersection of nature and industry. According to the RHS, the M&G Garden includes over 100 linear meters of metal sculpture that traces around the garden. This sculpture calls attention to our industrial past while highlighting the need for dense urban spaces to include sanctuaries of nature and beauty.

Though designers Harris and Bugg wish a normal spring show were possible, they’re equally as excited about the new kinds of plants they can showcase in autumn. [Learn more about the garden](https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/virtual-chelsea/gardens/2021/the-m-g-garden).

## Gaze Burvill Trade Stand by Ann-Marie Powell

Inspired by the shift towards home entertainment since the 2019 Chelsea show, Ann-Marie Powell will present a display focused on the idea of reuniting with friends in a garden setting.

She’ll showcase a variety of Gaze Burvill products and floral displays, as well as an outdoor kitchen and pizza grill. On the whole, the display serves as somewhere to sit quietly, reflect, and appreciate the rise of at-home gardening, [according to Powell’s website](https://www.ann-mariepowell.com/ampg-designs-for-gaze-burvill-at-rhs-chelsea-2021/).
