**One of the Most Exciting Trends of 2018 Has Arrived: [Augmented Reality](https://www.rd.com/culture/technology-trends-2018/)**

And in response to the fast-moving development of this technology, tech companies are creating new workflows. As a prime example of this, we have added AR capabilities to our free Vectorworks Nomad mobile app, specifically a new viewing mode that is available on iOS devices that support Apple’s ARKit technology.
