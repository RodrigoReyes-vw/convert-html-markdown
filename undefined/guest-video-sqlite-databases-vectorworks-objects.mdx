This video covers the essentials of connecting parametric objects in Vectorworks to SQLite databases, enabling you to set up links to external data via a lookup ID code (a “Primary Key” in SQLite terms). It shows:

* How to set up the external database
* How to connect objects in a Vectorworks drawing by ID code to the external database
* How to bring the external data into the drawn objects within the Vectorworks drawing
