###### Algorithms-Aided Design in BIM Software

_Aired September 27_

Algorithms-aided design tools are being used more and more frequently in the AEC industry. They bring endless opportunities for customization and automation within your design software and allow you more experimentation and optimization within your designs. You may find algorithms-aided design intimidating, but the most important thing you need to get started is simply a problem you want to solve.

In this presentation, Sarah Barrett, senior architect product specialist, discusses some basics of algorithmic modeling, give examples of scripts that you can build in BIM software, and look at several real-world algorithmic modeling success stories. 

This course is also approved for one AIA LU.

###### Data-Driven Design for Live Events

_Aired September 28_

Successful live event design isn’t only about the aesthetics of an event, it also requires effective and efficient data management on your end. From time and budget planning, to knowing seating assignments, being able to use your live event’s data is invaluable.

This webinar — using a gala-style dinner as an example — shows how you can benefit from integrating Vectorworks Spotlight’s data management and analysis tools into your design and planning processes.
