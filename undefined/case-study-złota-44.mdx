Architecture often represents a city and its people. That’s what the designers at Studio Libeskind and Artchitecture had in mind when they created the new icon of Warsaw, Złota 44\. Their strategically designed building, and the tallest residential tower in its class in the European Union, has transformed the city.

See how this high-end Złota 44 complex was designed by a strong team of collaborators and the use of Vectorworks software.
